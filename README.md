Files are collected here just for peer review. If you need to use them
create a folder for both `<Class-name>.h` `<Class-name>.cpp` and make sure
its path is the same of other library your IDE is already using
(to me that means `/usr/share/arduino/libraries`). Then you can manage
every make/build task from the IDE the same way you'd compile sketch
with no lib's.

Since I'm not that fluent in C++ wherever you find something strange
...that's *not* writing style, it's simply an error. Feel free to
point me improvements.
