Files are collected here just for peer review. Since I'm not that fluent in C++ wherever you find something strange ...that's **not** writing style, it's simply an error. Feel free to point me improvements.

If you want to use it you can [download](https://github.com/giuscri/AllertaDuino/archive/master.zip "Download ZIP") the zip archive, hence when opening the IDE and import this library. For more detailed info's see the official [Arduino guide](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries), where you can find also an different procedure if the one described above does not work.

For better understanding libraries, look at the examples source code -- which you can run from the IDE as well once library's been imported.
